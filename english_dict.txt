While hiking near the volcano, we saw a falcon soaring above a strange cactus field. As night fell, we used a lantern to find our way through a dark tunnel and stumbled upon an old pirate map hidden inside a rusty compass. A sudden tornado made us take shelter inside an igloo replica at the visitor center, where a robot offered us marshmallows and told a story about a mermaid who lived near an iceberg. Later, we played a game of puzzle solving while listening to the soft whisper of the wind. Outside, the moonlight reflected on a spaceship model beside a giant jellyfish sculpture. The next morning, we saw a wizard figurine beside a quicksand warning sign, and a signpost shaped like an echo chamber led us back. Our luggage was covered in slippery mud, but we found comfort lying in a hammock, watching the sky clear after an avalanche. We ended the trip eating a crisp apple by the lake
